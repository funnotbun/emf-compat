/**
 * A hang belongs to ParCool alone: while one runs, no addon poses the player.
 *
 * <p>ParCool's hangs — under a bar, off a ledge, and the climb up off one — are drawn by the
 * resource pack from the {@code parcool_*} variables, and the core restores addon poses
 * <em>after</em> the pack has animated. So an addon holding the arms overwrites the pack's hands,
 * and since a hang reads almost entirely as "both arms up", the player is left standing upright in
 * mid-air. Carry On, TACZ, Better Combat, Hackers 'n Slashers and Exposure all did this.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sharing the hands was tried and dropped: splitting them (one hand holding on, the other left
 * to the addon) is not worth what it costs to read. A hang is two-handed, so ParCool simply claims
 * the player through {@link PoseManager#setExclusive} and the addons' poses are dropped for its
 * duration. Nothing here has to reproduce the hang — the claim only keeps everyone else off it.</p>
 *
 * <p>TACZ is the one addon that may get better than silence: if its gun can be put away into the
 * holster for the length of the move, it should be, rather than simply frozen. Until then it is
 * treated like the rest.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only hangs. A crouch, a run or a charge leaves the arms shared as before — those were checked
 * in game and read correctly.</p>
